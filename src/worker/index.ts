// Cloudflare Worker that consumes the "hello" and "hello-dlq" queues — an
// independently deployed second Worker, entirely separate from the
// SvelteKit app's own Worker (wrangler.jsonc). Wired up via the
// [[queues.consumers]] entries in wrangler.queue.jsonc at the repo root.
//
// Ack/retry semantics are per-message, not per-batch: each message is
// ack()'d on success or retry()'d on failure individually, and a failure is
// caught and logged rather than rethrown across the whole batch — so one bad
// message doesn't block or force a retry of its batch-mates.
//
// OpenTelemetry / distributed tracing is out of scope here: doing it
// properly would need a third-party Workers OTel shim, which isn't a current
// dependency. `traceId` still flows through the envelope and every log line
// below, though, so grep-based correlation across the SvelteKit app and this
// Worker keeps working — just without span-level tracing.
//
// Imports stay relative with explicit ".ts" extensions: wrangler's esbuild
// bundling of this Worker doesn't resolve the "$lib/*" path alias (that's a
// Vite/SvelteKit-only mechanism), and — more strictly than that — must never
// transitively reach a SvelteKit-only virtual module like
// "$env/dynamic/private" (used by src/lib/server/queue.ts and
// src/lib/server/logger.ts), since plain esbuild can't resolve those at all
// and the build would hard-fail regardless of tree-shaking. See
// src/lib/internal/use_case/jobs.ts's module-level comment for the full
// explanation of why enqueueHelloJob takes its producer by injection instead
// of this Worker's entry point ever importing src/lib/server/queue.ts.
